- unify match behavior:
 default *foo*
 -e foo
 -r (-R ?) regexp foo.*

- disable color when tty = NULL; may break less?

- multiline reads don't yet work for quse/qsearch

- standardize/unify/clean up misc handling of colors

- qmerge
	- dep resolver needs spanktastic love.
	- needs safe deleting (merge in place rather than unmerge;merge)
	- handle compressed Packages file (talk to zmedico)
	- gpg sign the packages file (before compression)
	- binary vdb (sqlite) ... talk to zmedico
	- remote vdb

- atoms:
	- only 32bit values are supported for revision (-r#)
	- only 64bit values are supported in any individual version component
		foo-(1234)_alpha(56789)
	- these limits should not be an issue for all practical purposes
