- unify match behavior:
 default *foo*
 -e foo
 -r (-R ?) regexp foo.*

- disable color when tty = NULL; may break less?

- multiline reads don't yet work for quse/qsearch

- standardize/unify/clean up misc handling of colors

- speed up queue structure ... append walks the whole list

- qmerge
	- dep resolver needs spanktastic love.
	- needs safe deleting (merge in place rather than unmerge;merge)
	- multiple binary repos (talk to zmedico)
	- handle compressed Packages file (talk to zmedico)
	- handle binary Packages file (talk to zmedico)
	- gpg sign the packages file (before compression)
	- binary vdb (sqlite) ... talk to zmedico
	- remote vdb
	- don't bother emitting any "DIR" entries to CONTENTS ?
		- auto rmdir any empty dirs
	- avoid Packages fetching all the damned time
	- parallel fetch tbz2s
	- check order of pkg_{pre,post}{inst,rm} during install, unmerge, and upgrade
	- env is not saved/restored between pkg_{pre,post}inst (see portage and REPO_LAYOUT_CONF_WARN)
	- support installing via path to tbz2 package
	- support TTL field in binpkgs file

- atoms:
	- only 32bit values are supported for revision (-r#)
	- only 64bit values are supported in any individual version component
		foo-(1234)_alpha(56789)
	- these limits should not be an issue for all practical purposes
	- need to handle USE deps like: cat/pkg-123[foo(+)]
	- show support slots like: qmerge -U automake:1.12

- qcache:
	- need to convert it to new metadata/md5 style

- qdepends:
	- support querying uninstalled packages (via metadata/md5 cache)

- env vars only get expanded once, so this fails:
	ACCEPT_LICENSE="foo"
	ACCEPT_LICENSE="${ACCEPT_LICENSE} bar"
  we end up getting just:
	ACCEPT_LICENSE=" bar"

- qpkg:
	- fix "would be freed" message when --pretend is *not* active
	- add a verbose output that describes why a package is cleaned
		- newer binpkgs available
		- newer installed version available

- qsync:
	- rewrite to use new repos.conf standard
