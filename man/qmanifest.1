.SH NAME
qmanifest \- verify or generate thick Manifest files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmanifest
\fI[opts] <misc args>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIqmanifest\fR allows to verify or generate thick signed Manifests in
an ebuild tree.  By default, \fIqmanifest\fR will verify the main tree
as specified by Portage's configuration (one can check which using
\fIq\fR \fB-o\fR).  In this mode, it will output some information about
the GPG signature of the top-level Manifest file, and further reports on
any problems it encounters.
.P
This applet was originally a standalone program \fIhashgen\fR and its
alias \fIhashverify\fR.  Aliases for these names are still available for
historical reasons.  With the incorporation of \fIhashgen\fR in
\fBportage-utils\fR, development on the former has stopped in favour of
the latter.
.P
The arguments to \fIqmanifest\fR can be directories or names of
overlays.  By default, each argument is attempted to be matched against
all overlay names, and if that fails, treated as directory to presume a
tree is in.  This behaviour can be overridden with the \fB-d\fR and
\fB-o\fR flags to force treating the arguments as directories or
overlay names respectively.  Note that overlay names are those as
defined in \fIrepos.conf\fR from Portage's configuration.  The
\fIrepo_name\fR files from the overlays themselves (if present) are
ignored.
.P
This applet does similar things as \fIapp-portage/gemato\fR.  However,
the output and implemented strategies are completely different.  When
compiled with \fBUSE=openmp\fR, this applet will exploit parallelism
where possible to traverse a tree.  Should you want to limit the number
of parallel threads, export \fBOMP_NUM_THREADS\fR in your environment
with the desired maximum amount of threads in use by \fIqmanifest\fR.
