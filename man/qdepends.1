.SH NAME
qdepends \- show dependency info
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qdepends
\fI[opts] <pkgname>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I qdepends
applet has a couple different modes.  Normally it is geared towards
answering the queries "what does package X depend on" and "what packages depend
on X".  Both can further be classified into build, run, and post dependencies.

By default, it will tell you the build time dependencies only (DEPEND).

Currently,
.I qdepends
will only query installed packages.  There is no support for
querying packages not yet installed (see \fBequery\fR(1) for that).

If there is no answer to your query (i.e. you've asked for a package that is not
installed, or a version that does not match), then you will get back no output.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-depend\fR
Show DEPEND info (default).
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-rdepend\fR
Show RDEPEND info.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pdepend\fR
Show PDEPEND info.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-bdepend\fR
Show BDEPEND info.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-key\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Advanced option to allow querying the VDB.  This option overrides
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-r\fR, \fB\-p\fR, \fB\-b\fR or \fB\-a\fR.
\fI<arg>\fR can be any key from Portage's VDB, e.g.\ any file from
var/db/pkg/<cat>/<pkg>/.
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR \fI<arg>\fR, \fB\-\-query\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Query reverse deps.  This basically reverses the search to any
package that references \fI<arg>\fR in DEPEND, RDEPEND, PDEPEND or BDEPEND.
This can be useful to find consumers of a given package, e.g.\ to
search for packages that have \fIlogwatch\fR in their DEPEND.
.TP
\fB\-N\fR, \fB\-\-name\-only\fR
Only show category/package, instead of category/package-version.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Show *DEPEND, alias for \fB\-drpb\fR.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR
Pretty-print DEPEND declaration to be used in an ebuild.  This
option initiates a very different mode of operation.  Instead of
printing searching through packages, it constructs a multi-line
statement in with shell syntax, to be used in an ebuild.  Each
argument is turned into a separate DEPEND variable declaration.  You
need to quote dependency strings in order for them to be printed as
a single dependency declaration.  When used with the \fB\-q\fR
option, only the pretty-printed dependency declaration is printed,
e.g.\ the DEPEND= part is skipped.
.TP
\fB\-\-root\fR \fI<arg>\fR
Set the ROOT env var.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
When in reverse dep mode, print the package or packages that matched
the query from the dependency line being searched.  This includes
specifiers and versions.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress DEPEND= output for \fB\-f\fR.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-nocolor\fR
Don't output color.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version and exit.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
For finding out what a particular package depends on for building, you could do:
.nf
	$ \fIqdepends nano\fR
	app-editors/nano-2.3.2: >=sys-libs/ncurses-5.9-r1[unicode] sys-apps/file ...
.fi
This tells us that we have \fIapp-editors/nano-2.3.2\fR installed and it depends
on ncurses (among other things).

Searching for packages that actually have nano in their RDEPEND:
.nf
	$ \fIqdepends -rQ nano\fR
	virtual/editor-0
.fi
Tells us that \fIvirtual/editor\fR depends on nano.  However, if we
wanted to know in what way a package specifically depends on another
package, one can use \fB\-v\fR.
.nf
	$ \fIqdepends -vrQ logrotate\fR
	sys-apps/portage-2.3.18: >=app-admin/logrotate-3.8.0
.fi
This way we can see there is a specific dependency expressed here.  If
the above had used \fI<logrotate-3\fR, for example, no matches would be
returned.  Not using any specifiers allows to reveal in what way a
dependency is expressed.
