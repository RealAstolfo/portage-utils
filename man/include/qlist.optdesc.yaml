installed: |
    Instead of listing the contents of a package, just print the package
    name if the package is currently installed.
umap: |
    List USE-flags enabled when the package was installed.  This flag
    implies \fB\-I\fR.
slot: |
    Display installed packages with slots (use twice for subslots).
    This flag implies \fB\-I\fR.
repo: |
    Display installed packages with repository the ebuild originated from.
    This flag implies \fB\-I\fR.
columns: |
    Like \fB\-Iv\fR, but package name and version are separated by a
    space for easy consumption by e.g.\ shell scripts which can read
    space-separated columns.
verbose: |
    When used with \fB\-I\fR, print the package version next to name.
    When listing the package contents, a single \fB\-v\fR displays
    symlinks with an arrow (\->) to their target.  Two or more \fB\-v\fR
    adds colour to the entries and prints like \fB\-I\fR before the
    listing.
quiet: |
    Suppresses the parenthesis around the USE-flags when used with \fB\-U\fR.
