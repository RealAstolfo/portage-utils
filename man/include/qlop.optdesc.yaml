date: |
    Limit the selection of packages to the date given, or to the range
    of dates if this argument is given twice.  The \fB--date\fR option
    can take a few forms.
    .RS
    .IP "NUMBER <day|week|month|year>[s] [ago]"
    Relative time, specifying \fINUMBER\fR \fIdays\fR, \fIweeks\fR,
    \fImonths\fR or \fIyears\fR, for example \fI3 days ago\fR.
    .IP today
    Alias for \fI0 days ago\fR.
    .IP yesterday
    Alias for \fI1 day ago\fR.
    .IP YYYY-MM-DD
    Big-endian date, with components separated by hyphens, starting with
    year, followed by month and day of month.
    .IP SSSSSSSSS
    Seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC), the UNIX epoch.
    .IP FORMAT|DATE
    Use \fIFORMAT\fR as input for \fBstrptime\fR(3) to parse \fIDATE\fR.
    .RE
time: |
    Show the time it took to merge, unmerge or sync.
average: |
    Calculate average merge, unmerge or sync time.  This is the average
    time for all occurrences found respecting any date limits.
summary: |
    Show a grand total for averages.  This option implies \fB-a\fR.
    Useful to compute time it takes to recompile all packages or a set
    of packages (e.g\. world).
human: |
    Print elapssed time in human readable format.  This form uses
    minutes, hours and days instead of just seconds.
current: |
    Show current emerging packages.  This relies on
    .I FEATURES=sandbox
    in order to detect running merges.
verbose: |
    Print package versions and revisions (PF) instead of package (PN).
running: |
    Print operations currently in progress.  An ETA is calculated based
    on the average for the operation.  If the elapsed exceeds the
    average, the ETA is calculated against the longest time observed for
    the operation.  If the elapsed time exceeds this too, or no previous
    occurrences for the operation exist, \fIunknown\fR is printed.
