.SH "EXAMPLES"
For finding out what a particular package depends on for building, you could do:
.nf
	$ \fIqdepends nano\fR
	app-editors/nano-2.3.2: >=sys-libs/ncurses-5.9-r1[unicode] sys-apps/file ...
.fi
This tells us that we have \fIapp-editors/nano-2.3.2\fR installed and it depends
on ncurses (among other things).
