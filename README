- Fetching via anoncvs.
The cvs module for gentoo-projects is mirrored. You may download a 
pretty recent copy using the following command. Note: that this is not 
the official cvs server but rather a mirror so it lags about a hour or 
so behind the real tree which is hosted on cvs.gentoo.org

# Will soon be replaced with.
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gentoo.org:/var/cvsroot -q co -R gentoo-projects/portage-utils
