Dev Notes:

- Speed is everything.
  Having your PORTDIR and VDB on the right file system helps dramatically

  IDE raid with PORTDIR on reiserfs:
    q -r
    q: Finished 20655 entries in 1.990951 seconds

  IDE raid with PORTDIR on ext3:
    q -r
    q: Finished 20655 entries in 203.664252 seconds


- Fetching via anoncvs.
The cvs module for gentoo-projects is mirrored. You may download a 
pretty recent copy using the following command. Note: that this is not 
the official cvs server but rather a mirror so it lags about an hour or 
so behind the real tree which is hosted on cvs.gentoo.org

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@zarquon.twobit.net:/var/cvsroot -q -z9 co -R gentoo-projects/portage-utils


- Adding applets is easy using the q framework.
  Note: Please try to keep applet names under 8 chars.
	* cp template.c qmyapplet.c (all applets use the prefix of the letter 'q') 
	* applets.h: add your prototype (see DECLARE_APPLET macro)
	* applets.h: add a new line to applets[] following the existing syntax
	* run `make depend` to auto regenerate dependent files

When and where you can please try to use an existing applet and extend 
on its functionality by adding more options vs adding a bunch of new 
little applets.
