- Speed is everything.
  Having your PORTDIR and VDB on the right file system helps dramatically

  IDE raid with PORTDIR on reiserfs:
    q -r
    q: Finished 20655 entries in 1.990951 seconds

  IDE raid with PORTDIR on ext3:
    q -r
    q: Finished 20655 entries in 203.664252 seconds


- Fetching via anoncvs.
The cvs module for gentoo-projects is mirrored. You may download a 
pretty recent copy using the following command. Note: that this is not 
the official cvs server but rather a mirror so it lags about a hour or 
so behind the real tree which is hosted on cvs.gentoo.org
