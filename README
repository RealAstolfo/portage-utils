/* Add notes here */

- multiline reads don't yet work for quse/qsearch

- quse needs a rewrite.

- Fetching via anoncvs.
The cvs module for gentoo-projects is mirrored. You may download a 
pretty recent copy using the following command. Note: that this is not 
the official cvs server but rather a mirror so it lags about an hour or 
so behind the real tree which is hosted on cvs.gentoo.org

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@zarquon.twobit.net:/var/cvsroot -q -z9 co -R gentoo-projects/portage-utils

- Adding applets is easy using the q framework.
cp template.c qmyapplet.c (all applets use the prefix of the letter 'q') 
edit applets.h add your prototype, applet definition to the enum then 
incr LAST_APPLET.  Scroll down the typedef for applets[] and add your 
applet name following the existing syntax. Please try to keep applet 
names under 8 chars.

When and where you can please try to use an existing applets and extend 
on it's functionality by adding more options vs adding a ton of new 
applets.
